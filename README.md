# Requirements
Conda environments with: <br>
Orfipy at https://github.com/urmi-21/orfipy <br>
kofam_scan at https://github.com/takaram/kofam_scan

# Step 1: download database of genomes
NCBI has sortable database of genomes which can be sorted for quality. I recommend you only take genomes of the highest quality and consider renaming files to be human readable. 

# Step 2: use orfipy to extract open reading frames (ORFs)
